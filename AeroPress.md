### Intro
Always use clean water. Remember to moisten the filter. This method works nice with dark roasted coffee.
### Single cup - Strong dark roasted coffee

* Ca. 2.2 dl water
* 26 gr/ 2 scoops (the Aeropress scoope) freshly ground coffee, a bit finer than French Press

### Instructions

* Moister the filter and put it in the holder. Attach the holder to the Aeropress and put it on top of the cup.
* Add the coffee.
* Start a timer.
* Fill water up to the 2 mark and stir for 15 seconds.
* Fill the rest of the water up to the 4 mark. Let the coffee bloom until the timer hits 45 - 47 seconds.
* Press down slowly, try to hit the 1 minute and 25 seconds mark.
