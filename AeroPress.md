## Single cup - Espresso-like brew, regular style

### Intro

The Aeropress can never make _true espresso_, since that requires a pressure of 9 bar. But it can come pretty close.
This method is used to create a concentrate that can be used for other coffee drinks, or as is. Works well with most types of coffee.

Always use clean water. Remember to moisten the filters.

* 100 gr water
* 32 gr freshly ground coffee, somewhere between filter and espresso.

### Instructions

* Moister the filter and put it in the holder. Attach the holder to the Aeropress and put it on top of the cup.
* Add the coffee.
* Pour the water over the coffee and stir for 10 full seconds.
* Use the Aeropress plunger to press the water through the grounds for 20 seconds.

### Note

* For the best result, the brew process should take no more than 30 seconds.

## Single cup - Espresso-like brew, double filters

### Intro

The Aeropress can never make _true espresso_, since that requires a pressure of 9 bar. But it can come pretty close.
